# NBA Results Prediction

This project aims to predict the winner of the NBA playoffs by using a supervised learning approach based on historical data. The objective is to predict the winner of the 2023 playoffs by analyzing team performances during matches and considering various factors that influence the final score.

## Key Steps

1. **Importing Libraries**: We import the Pandas and NumPy libraries for data manipulation and calculations.

2. **Data Loading and Preparation**: We gather historical NBA playoff match data. We examine the statistics of each match played by participating teams and associate the match outcome (win or loss) to create a comprehensive database. Both individual and collective team performances are taken into account. Columns are converted to appropriate data types, and missing values are handled.

3. **Feature Selection**: We select relevant features for our prediction model. Emphasis is placed on collective team game statistics.

4. **Data Splitting**: The data is split into training and test sets to evaluate the model's performance. Typically, a 65% - 35% split is used, with 65% for training and 35% for testing.

5. **Model Training**: We utilize the Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm for binary classification. SVM is a powerful model that seeks to find an optimal hyperplane to separate the two classes in a higher-dimensional space. SVM is chosen for its proven classification ability.

6. **Model Evaluation**: We evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy (prediction precision) on the test set. A prediction accuracy of 90% is achieved on this set.

7. **Prediction of 2023 Finals Results**: We use the average statistics of the finalist teams to predict the results of each match in the finals. By comparing team performances and accumulating wins, we determine the winner. The team that wins four matches is crowned the NBA 2023 champion.
